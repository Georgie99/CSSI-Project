  <h1 align="center"><b>About</b></h1>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">Super Smash Bros. (大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ),  is a series of fighting games published by Nintendo, featuring characters from franchises established on Nintendo systems. Despite its immense popularity — not to mention the frenzied hype and anticipation that comes during the lead-up to each new instalment — the origins of the Super Smash Bros. series are in fact remarkably humble. When its creator, Masahiro Sakurai, initially came up with the concept in the late 1990s, he didn't have a team of hundreds of staff or a bottomless budget to call upon — he didn't even have Nintendo's approval.</p>
<p align="center">The main inspiration for this project was the immense popularity of Super Smash Brothers during our breaks in CSSI. However a problem arise - there’s was no support for beginner level players. Match after match, beginners would haphazardly be forced into characters that weren’t meant for their individual needs and their inexperience would be seen as an easy target by other players. Our group <i>Broke Girls Technology</i> wants to resolve this issue by issuing an Super Smash Brothers Generator. Our Smash Brothers Generator can generate characters through your individual preferences and if you login, your preferences will be saved! And if you don’t like your original preference, you can change it anytime! <b>Our Preference System is one of a kind</b> - it understand it ties in your skill level, your prefer fighting status, and even your prefer character color!</p>

<h1 align="center"><b>History of Smash Brothers</b></h1>
<br>
<p align="center">The game was released shortly after the GameCube's launch in both Japan and the United States near the end of 2001, as Super Smash Bros. Melee, and received critical acclaim as both a strong fundamental improvement and a massive expansion of content over its predecessor. The game became the best-selling GameCube game, with more than seven million copies sold worldwide.</p>

<p align="center">Super Smash Bros. Brawl was critically and commercially successful upon release, garnering praise for its new focus on improved single-player content, a further-expanded and better-varied cast, and one of the largest video game soundtracks in history, and became the fastest-selling game in Nintendo of America's history and a seller of over 10 million units total. However, the game also drew reviewer criticism for long loading times and a laggy online experience. Multiplayer aspects were controversial among the established player-base (such as the competitive circles of which had long been accustomed to the gameplay styles of Melee) for a comparatively slower pace and scale of gravity, the removal of some advanced movement and attack mechanics, and a much heavier slant towards defensive gameplay. Most universally disliked was the game's inclusion of tripping, a non-negotiable element of randomized chance that could easily dictate the outcome of a competitive match in a manner that rewarded luck over skill. In an interview two-and-a-half years after the release of Brawl, Sakurai revealed that he himself retrospectively considered Melee to be "the sharpest game in the series."
Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U (2014) is the first instance of the series releasing two separate versions of the game for different platforms on the 3DS and Wii U, and there are content differences between versions such as stages. New franchises that have been confirmed to have primary representation are Animal Crossing, the Wii Fit line of fitness hardware and software, Punch-Out!!, Monolift Soft's Xenoblade series, the well-known NES classic, Duck Hunt, the third-party Mega Man franchise by Capcom, and the third-party Pac-Man franchise by Namco.Furthermore, the Mii avatars that became available for use in Nintendo hardware and software since 2006 are playable as characters. After the game's release, additional downloadable content became available and brought back Mewtwo and Roy from Melee as well as re-adding Lucas after he initially failed to make the roster. In addition, three more third-party franchises joined the series including Capcom's Street Fighter, SEGA & Platinum Games' Bayonetta and in a move that shocked the gaming industry, Square Enix's mascot series, Final Fantasy. The 3DS version was released on September 13, 2014 (Japan) and October 3, 2014 (Americas and Europe), while the Wii U version released on November 21, 2014 in the Americas, November 28, 2014 in Europe, November 29, 2014 in Australia, and December 6, 2014 in Japan.

<p align="center">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018) is an upcoming title for the Nintendo Switch. This game will feature all previous veterans and also added the Splatoon universe to the list of universes with playable characters including for the first time ever in any Nintendo game, Ridley from the Metroid series as a playable fighter. In addition, fighters who were previously known as clones were now given the new official name of echo fighters with Mario's Princess Daisy announced to be a new echo of Peach. The game launches worldwide on December 7, 2018.</p>
